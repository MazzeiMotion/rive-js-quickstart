# rive-js-hightapi-template
This is a template to show you how to put your Rive files in a website.

It includes the .rev file (You don't need to upload this file to the server, it's the original Rive file. The same way in Photoshop you have the PSD file and then export for example as JPEG, in Rive you have the .rev file but you export as .riv to use in the runtimes. In this case the Javascript runtime.)
